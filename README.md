## Description

A code that calculates the time-dependent motion of tides on a water planet according to the [Laplace Tidal Equations](https://farside.ph.utexas.edu/teaching/336L/Fluid/node170.html).

This project was created in the context of the [2019 McGill Physics Hackathon](https://mcgill-physics-hackathon-2019.devpost.com/), and was awarded the Astro Prize at the end of a grueling yet fun 25 hours of coding.  We plan on improving our code in the future.
